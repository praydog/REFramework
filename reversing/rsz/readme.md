# `emulation-dumper.py`
Uses [Unicorn](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn) to emulate all of the deserializer chains to guess the RSZ structure layout for native (`via.*`) types.

### Arguments
* `p`
    * path to the game executable
* `il2cpp_path` 
    * path to `il2cpp_dump.json` (framework generated)
* `test_mode`
    * uses the `default_chains` global instead of `il2cpp_path` for chains

### Outputs
* `native_layouts_(exe_name).json`
* `dump_(exe_name).txt`

***

# `non-native-dumper.py`
* Generates the RSZ structures for non-native types
* Merges the natives into non-natives as needed (e.g. if a non-native has a native parent)
* Adds the native structures from `native_layouts_(exe_name).json` as well, so it's all in one file

### Arguments
* `out_postfix`
    * postfix added to output filename
* `il2cpp_path` 
    * path to `il2cpp_dump.json` (framework generated)
* `natives_path`
    * path to `native_layouts_(exe_name).json` that was generated by `emulation-dumper.py`
* `use_typedefs`
* `use_hashkeys`

### Outputs
`rsz(out_postfix).json`
